I am a software programming who is interested in building LLM agents.

I want to build products that give people more power over their lives.

I am not particularly interested in general hype around machine learning, AI, or 
LLMs. I am especially interested in specific tools and techniques that make it 
easier for people to process data, make decisions, and organize information.

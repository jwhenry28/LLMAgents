I am a software programming who is interested in building LLM agents.

I want to build products that give people more power over their lives.

I am not particularly interested in general hype around machine learning, AI, or 
LLMs. I am especially interested in specific tools and techniques that make it 
easier for people to process data, make decisions, and organize information.

Please only send me articles about tools or techniques that directly leverage LLMs. I 
am not interested in articles about tools or techniques that, while useful to 
data processing or decision-making generally, do not leverage LLMs.
